PowerDuke: Widespread Post-Election Spear Phishing Campaigns Targeting Think Tanks and NGOsNOVEMBER 9, 2016by Steven AdairFacebook Twitter EmailIn the wake of the 2016 United States Presidential Election, not even six hours after Donald Trump became the nation's President-Elect, an advanced persistent threat (APT) group launched a series of coordinated and well-planned spear phishing campaigns. Volexity observed five different attack waves with a heavy focus on U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These e-mails came from a mix of attacker created Google Gmail accounts and what appears to be compromised e-mail accounts at Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). These e-mails were sent in large quantities to different individuals across many organizations and individuals focusing in national security, defense, international affairs, public policy, and European and Asian studies. Two of the attacks purported to be messages forwarded on from the Clinton Foundation giving  insight and perhaps a postmortem analysis into the elections. Two of the other attacks purported to be eFax links or documents pertaining to the election's outcome being revised or rigged. The last attack claimed to be a link to a PDF download on "Why American Elections Are Flawed." Volexity believes a group it refers to as The Dukes (also known as APT29 or Cozy Bear) is responsible for post-election attack activity.BackgroundSince August of this year, Volexity has been actively involved in investigating and tracking several attack campaigns from the Dukes. Most notably the Dukes have previously been tied to the breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and intrusions into multiple high-profile United States Government organizations. In July 2015, the Dukes started heavily targeting  think tanks and NGOs. This represented a fairly significant shift in the group's previous operations and one that continued in the lead up to and immediately after the 2016 United States Presidential election.On August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016, the Dukes launched several waves of highly targeted spear phishing attacks against several U.S.-based think tanks and NGOs. These spear phishing messages were spoofed and made to appear to have been sent from real individuals at well-known think tanks in the United States and Europe. These August waves of attacks purported to be from individuals at Transparency International, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS),  the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Eurasia Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).The Dukes are known for launching their attacks by sending links to ZIP files, that contain malicious executables, hosted on legitimate compromised web servers. However, each of the e-mail messages from the August attacks contained a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) or Excel (.xls) attachment. These attachments, when viewed, contained legitimate report content from each of the organizations they appeared to have been sent from. However, the attackers inserted macros into the documents designed to install a malware downloader on the system. Successful exploitation would result in the download of a PNG image file from a compromised webserver. These attack campaigns leveraged steganography in the PNG files by hiding components of a backdoor that would exist only in memory after being loaded into rundll32.exe. Volexity has dubbed this backdoor PowerDuke. Similar attack campaigns using documents with macros dropping PowerDuke were further observed through October, where Universities, and not think tanks appear to have been the primary targets. Details of these attacks have been provided to Volexity customers. Concerned NGO's and Universities that may have been targeted by these attacks campaigns are welcome to reach out for additional details.November 9 - Post-Election Spear Phishing WavesThe post-election attacks launched by the Dukes on November 9 were very similar to previous attacks seen from the Dukes in both 2015 and 2016. The PowerDuke malware, first seen in August 2016, was once again used in these most recent attacks. Three of the five attack waves contained links to download files from domains that the attackers appear to have control over. The other two attacks contained documents with malicious macros embedded within them. Each of these different attack waves were slightly different from one another and are detailed below.Attack Wave 1: eFax - The "Shocking" Truth About Election RiggingThe first attack wave is similar to much older attacks from the Dukes that purport to be an electronic Fax. This message claims to have been sent from Secure Fax Corp. and has a link to a ZIP file that contains a Microsoft shortcut file (.LNK). This shortcut file contains PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean decoy document. The e-mail message was sent from the attacker controlled e-mail account [email protected]. The screen shot below shows the e-mail that was sent.cozy-efax-linkThe e-mail contained links pointing to the following URL:hxxp://efax.pfdweek[.]com/eFax/message0236.ZIPInside of this password (1854) protected ZIP file is a Microsoft shortcut file named:37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnkNote that pfdweek[.]com appears to be under the control of the attackers but may be a hijacked domain.Details on each of the files are included below.Filename: message0236.ZIPFile size: 643843 bytesMD5 hash: bea0a6f069bd547db685698bc9f9d25aSHA1 hash: ee09bec09388338134d47fa993d5e0f86efe5bd4Notes: Password protected ZIP file containing malicious Microsoft shortcut file (37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk)Filename: 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnkFile size: 724003 bytesMD5 hash: c272aebc661c54cc960ba9a4a3578952SHA1 hash: 52d62213c66a603e33dab326bf4fa29d6ac681c4Notes: Microsoft shortcut file with embedded PowerShell, PowerDuke backdoor (hqwhbr.lck), and clean decoy document.Filename: kxwn.lockFile size:  10752 bytesMD5 hash: 28b95a2c399e60ee535c32e73860fbeaSHA1 hash: bf4ce67b6e745e26fcf3a2d41938a9dff1395076Notes: Primary PowerDuke backdoor (DLL) loader (leverages kxwn.lock:schemas) dropped to "%APPDATA\Roaming\Microsoft\" with persistence via HKCU Run Key "WebCache" (rundll32.exe %APPDATA\Roaming\Microsoft\kxwn.lock , #2).

This appears to be consistent with several previous Dukes attack campaigns, such as those on August 25, 2016. The Macros contain several anti-VM checks designed to avoid executing in virtualized environments.

The e-mail purports to have been sent from Harvard's "PDF Mobile Service" or "PFD Mobile Service". The spelling of this non-existent service is inconsistent in the e-mail.  The latter spelling appears to be a typographical error that is consistent with the domain names registered by the attackers.

The link in the e-mail points to a ZIP file that has a Microsoft shortcut file (.LNK) inside of it. This shortcut file contains PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean decoy document. Like Attack Wave #3, this e-mail message also purported to be forwarded from Laura Graham at the Clinton Foundation. The message body contained dozens of e-mail addresses to which the message originally claims to have been sent, with organizations similar to Attack Wave #3. The e-mail message from this attack wave, with identifying information removed, is shown below.cozy-link2cozy-link2-bottomAs seen in the screen shot above, the e-mail contained links pointing to the following URL:hxxp://efax.pfdregistry[.]net/eFax/37486.ZIPInside of this password (6190) protected ZIP file a Microsoft Shortcut file named:37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnkNote that pfdregistry[.]net appears to be under the control of the attackers but may be a hijacked domain.Details on the malware components of this attack wave are included below.Filename: 37486.ZIPFile size: 580688 bytesMD5 hash: f79caf27a99c091e6c1775b306993341SHA1 hash: a76c02c067eae26d78f4b494274dfa6aedc6fa7aNotes: Password protected ZIP file containing malicious Microsoft shortcut file 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk.Filename: 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnkFile size: 661782 bytesMD5 hash: f713d5df826c6051e65f995e57d6817dSHA1 hash: 68ce4c0324f03976247ff48803a7d988f9f9f43fNotes: Microsoft shortcut file with embedded PowerShell, PowerDuke backdoor (hqwhbr.lck), and clean decoy document.Filename: hqwhbr.lckFile size: 10752 bytesMD5 hash: 57c627d68e156676d08bfc0829b94331SHA1 hash: 4bcbf078a78ba0e842f78963ba9dd71240ab6a6dNotes: PowerDuke backdoor file dropped to "%APPDATA\Roaming\Skype\" with persistence via HKCU Run Key "IAStorIcon" (rundll32.exe %APPDATA\Roaming\Apple\hqwhbr.lck, #2).

Volexity suspects the feature set that has been built into PowerDuke is an extension of their anti-VM capabilities in the initial dropper files. Several commands supported by PowerDuke facilitate getting information about the system.A previous analysis of PowerDuke showed it supported the following commands.comp	get the NetBIOS name via GetComputerNameExdomain	get the computer's domain via NetWkstaGetInfodrives	get logical drives, drive type, free space, serial number, etc.fsize	get the size of a file via GetFileAttributesExW or failing that, by mapping the file and getting the sizekill	stop a process via TerminateProcessmemstat	get memory usage status via GlobalMemoryStatusEx, total RAM, percent used, etc.osdate	get the time the machine was built (via InstallDate registry key)osver	get OS info via registry, such as ProductName, CurrentBuild, CurrentVersion, CSDBuildNumber, etc.pslist	list processes via CreateToolhelp32Snapshotpwd	get current directory via GetCurrentDirectoryWrun	start a process via CreateProcessW#	runs cmd.exe /c and gets the output via Named Pipe and sends the data backsiduser	gets the current user's SID via GetTokenInformation and LookupAccountSidWtime	the time + timezone (GetLocalTime and GetTimeZoneInformation)uptime	number of seconds since the last bootuser	the user's name via GetUserNameExWwipe	writes random data across a file, then deletes the filewnd	gets the text of the current foreground windowfgetp	download filefputp	upload filepower	reboot or shutdown (via previously loaded PowrProf.dll)cdt	change to temporary directoryreqdelay	sleep for specified timeVolexity has not fully examined the PowerDuke instances from these campaigns but has noted the malware appears to support the following additional commands not described above:sidcompbuzyexitcopydetectavmkdirsoftwareshlistshinfoshdelshaddsetpngconnsetsrvVolexity may update this post following further PowerDuke analysis.Network IndicatorsBelow are network indicators associated with download URLs for the aforementioned Dukes attack campaigns.Hostname	IP Address	ASN Informationefax.pfdresearch.org	81.82.196.162	6848 | 81.82.0.0/15 | TELENET | BE | telenet.be | Telenet Operaties N.V.efax.pfdregistry.net	65.15.88.243	7018 | 65.15.64.0/19 | ATT-INTERNET4 | US | bellsouth.net | Bellsouth.net Inc.efax.pfdweek.com	84.206.44.194	31581 | 84.206.0.0/16 | KOPINT | HU | ekg.kopdat.hu | National Infocommunications Service Company Limited by SharesBelow are network indicators associated with command and control servers for the aforementioned Dukes attack campaigns.IP Address	ASN Information185.124.86.121	43260 | 185.124.86.0/24 | DGN | TR | - | -185.132.124.43	43260 | 185.132.124.0/24 | DGN | TR | - | -185.26.144.109	60721 | 185.26.144.0/24 | BURSABIL | TR | bursabil.com.tr | Bursabil Konfeksiyon Tekstil Bilisim Teknoloji insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi173.243.80.6	14979 | 173.243.80.0/24 | AERONET-WIRELESS | PR | aeronetpr.com | Aeronet Wireless177.10.96.30	262848 | 177.10.96.0/21 | Naja | BR | najatel.com.br | Naja Telecomunicacoes Ltda.ConclusionThe Dukes continue to launch well-crafted and clever attack campaigns. They have had tremendous success evading anti-virus and anti-malware solutions at both the desktop and mail gateway levels. The group's anti-VM macros and PowerShell scripts appear to have drastically reduced the number of sandboxes and bots that the group has to deal with on their command and control infrastructure. This combined with their use of steganography to hide their backdoor within PNG files that are downloaded remotely and loaded in memory only or via alternate data streams (ADS) is quite novel in its approach. Volexity believes that the Dukes are likely working to gain long-term access into think tanks and NGOs and will continue to launch new attacks for the foreseeable future.Follow us on Twitter: @Volexity, @stevenadair, @5ck, @imhlv2, @attrcAPT, Dukes, elections, spear phishing
